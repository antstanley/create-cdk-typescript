# create-cdk-typescript

Bootstrap a Typescript CDK Project.

CDK has it's own bootstrap command, but it's not ideal. This bootstrap project adds support for the following

- Optional ES Module support in Typescript
- `vitest` as the test framework, over `jest`
- Home folder selection
- Basic monorepo support
